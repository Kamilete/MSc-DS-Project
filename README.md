# A Geographically Weighted Regression model for identifying spatial non-stationarity in femicide data for Colombia

**Main goal:** Assess if the relationship between femicides and the covariates is constant (stationary) or variable (non-stationary) across municipalities in Colombia, and based on this analysis, we will be able to understand and identify the spatial patterns in the relationship between gender-based homicides in Colombia and their driving factors.

**Spatial method:** A Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model.
